    <p>This week there was fewer lines of code than last week. But, with this
week I have almost(except partial trace) merged all changes from
&#64;ellisonbg's densityop branch and ready to extend the implementation to
incorporate other features. &nbsp;Most of the time I spent this week is to
review and structure my work for the coming weeks and address comments
on previous PR . I have provided a detailed plan below.</p>
<div class="section" id="tasks-performed-this-week">
<h2>Tasks performed this week</h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">1. Responded to and completed all comments on last weeks pull <cite>PR1312.</cite></div>
<div class="line">2. Pushed a minor code change branch to my git account. This change handles <strong>entropy for general density operators</strong>. &nbsp;(<em>I am still waiting for the previous pull request to get merged, since this pull request was branched off that</em>).</div>
<div class="line">3. Review and understand the partial trace operations and qubit related implementation. &nbsp;Further notes will be prepared for the discussion.</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">4. Understand current implementation of tensor products to plan work for coming weeks.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="my-plan-for-weeks-3-4-5-6-based-on-design-discussion-we-have-had-regarding-partial-trace">
<h2>My plan for weeks 3,4,5,6 ( based on design discussion we have had regarding partial trace )</h2>
<p><em>(Note, the detailed plan here still meets the timeline outlined in the
proposal. The only change is I will be working fewer hours during Week
4(June 10-16), since I am at the summer school. Hopefully, I can contain
the work to not flow into later weeks).&nbsp;</em></p>
<div class="section" id="week-3-4">
<h3>Week 3/4</h3>
<p>Implement/test partial trace methods [ <strong>_eval_partial_trace</strong> ] and
other required methods for following classes:</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">QubitDensity (<em>name suggestion needed!</em>) : for this I will use the current bit-twiddling algorithm but add detailed test cases.</div>
<div class="line">TensorProduct : Code to handle density operators ( both qubit based and generic) during expand, mul operations.</div>
<div class="line">TensorProduct : _eval_partial_trace method will split the sub-system to trace. and then based on states inside Tr(|i&gt;&lt;k|).&nbsp;[<em>This needs more discussions during the next few days and during IRC session.</em>]</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Sub-classes of 'State' : Need to decide which subclasses need and how it should be done.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="week-5">
<h3>Week 5</h3>
<p>Symbolic Trace operations and Partial Trace operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="week-6">
<h3>Week 6</h3>
<p>Changes to qapply for L and R operations and any operations that would
be needed based on changes so far. (will also fix the bug identified in
PR 1312)</p>

<h2>Other related learning activities this week.</h2>
<p>I tried <a class="reference external" href="http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html">IPython Notebook</a> and I absolutely love it. Now, I am using
that as my command line interface for running sympy commands and
understanding current implementation. &nbsp;The best thing Notebook has done
to my workflow is help me save my scratch work and go back whenever I
need it. Thanks<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ellisonbg">&#64;ellisonbg</a>.</p>
<p>I did have to jump some hoops to set up Notebook on Ubuntu 11.04, since
I had to build a lot of dependencies myself. I plan to blog about it as
part of another post. &nbsp;A minor pain point with it is, I need to
drag/drop files I want to work on. Wish it gave me an option to type in
the URL to a saved notebook rather than forcing me to open a FileManager
window to find file to drag and drop.</p>
