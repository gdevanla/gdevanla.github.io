        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I recently managed to set up my Emacs environment to work with <code>haskell-language-server</code>. I took me a while to get this working and come up with a workflow. Since, it was not that straight forward to get this working, I have decided to share some of the nuances I learned during this process in this post.</p>
<p>Ideally, it would be nice if this kind of set up worked out of the box. But, we are not there yet. Therefore, it helps to understand some of the plumbing work going on below so that we can make sense of why something is not working and find our solution.</p>
<h1 id="understanding-the-setup-process">Understanding the <code>Setup</code> process</h1>
<h2 id="some-terminology">Some terminology:</h2>
<p>In this post, I discuss setting up <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server"><code>haskell-language-server</code></a> or also referred to as <code>hls</code>. For readers, who have been following recent development in this area, might be aware that this is an effort to bring together various <code>IDE</code> related tools (<code>hie-core</code>, <code>hie-bios</code> and <code>hie</code>) into one integrated experience. In short, this blog talks about <code>haskell-language-server</code> setup and not <code>hie</code> setup.</p>
<p><code>lsp-haskell</code> is the Emacs mode that supports talking to three different tools currently, that currently emulate a language-server. Currently, <code>haskell-lsp</code> supports three of these tools: <code>hie</code>, <code>haskell-language-server</code> and <code>ghcide</code>. We will focus on making this tool working with <code>haskell-language-server. (Note: The latest version of</code>lsp-haskell<code>, seems to have replaced this with a custom variable</code>lsp-haskell-server-path<code>) and the default value is set to</code>haskell-language-server-wrapper`).</p>
<p>I will assume you are on version of <code>Linux</code> and using <code>stack</code> for the rest of the blog post. The concepts described below applies to <code>cabal</code> setup as well.</p>
<p>As we go through this steps, I try to explain why we perform these steps and what is happening in the background. Knowing this allows us to debug the problems we face in the diverse environments these setup steps are designed to support.</p>
<h3 id="setting-up-haskell-language-server">Setting up haskell-language server</h3>
<p>You should pretty much follow the instructions for this from (<code>haskell-language-server</code>)[https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server}. The <code>README</code> has lot more information for different scenarios. Let’s distill this to what we need.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    git clone https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server --recurse-submodules
    cd haskell-language-server</code></pre>
<p>Then, comes the build step.</p>
<pre><code>    stack ./install.hs hls   # to install for latest available GHC version
</code></pre>
<p>But, this step is usually not sufficient. The <code>haskell-language-server</code> uses <code>ghcide</code> under the hood. If you tried to use the version of <code>haskell-language-server</code> which does not match the version of <code>GHC</code> your current project is using, then the <code>haskell-language-server</code> would either not load successfully or partially load leading to all kinds of confusion.</p>
<p>Therefore, I suggest, based on your projects <code>GHC</code> version dependencies, you can choose to build multiple versions of <code>haskell-language-server</code> using the supported <code>GHC</code> versions. You can do this as follows:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>
    stack ./install.hs hls-8.8.3
</code></pre>
<h4 id="tip-usually-i-have-multiple-version-of-haskell-language-server-as-i-have-projects-using-different-ghc-versions-at-any-point-in-time.">Tip: Usually, I have multiple version of <code>haskell-language-server</code> as I have projects using different GHC versions at any point in time.</h4>
<pre class="shell"><code># Here are some version that are supported, as of this writing

stack ./install.hs --help

...
  - hls-8.10.1
  - hls-8.10.2
  - hls-8.6.4
  - hls-8.6.5
  - hls-8.8.2
  - hls-8.8.3
  - hls-8.8.4
  - latest</code></pre>
<p>This step installs, different versions of the <code>haskell-language-server</code> into your <code>.local/bin</code> folder (on Linux version I am on). Here is what I have on my machine:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>
    /home/foouser/.local/bin/haskell-language-server
    /home/foouser/.local/bin/haskell-language-server-8.10
    /home/foouser/.local/bin/haskell-language-server-8.10.1
    /home/foouser/.local/bin/haskell-language-server-8.10.2
    /home/foouser/.local/bin/haskell-language-server-8.6
    /home/foouser/.local/bin/haskell-language-server-8.6.5
    /home/foouser/.local/bin/haskell-language-server-8.8
    /home/foouser/.local/bin/haskell-language-server-8.8.3
    /home/foouser/.local/bin/haskell-language-server-wrapper
</code></pre>
<p>This completes our set up of <code>haskell-language-server</code>. What we want to take away from this step, is the need for different<code>haskell-language-server</code> versions to successfully work with the <code>lsp</code> client. Note, that later versions of language server report an error to the <code>lsp-client</code> when the <code>ghcide</code> versions don’t match. But, the earlier version may not report this which could lead to IDE environment not working as expected.</p>
<h1 id="bridging-haskell-language-server-with-the-ghc-api-using-hie-bios-cradles">Bridging <code>haskell-language-server</code> with the <code>GHC API</code> using <code>hie-bios cradles</code></h1>
<p>This is an important step that I had glossed over initially and paid a dear 2-hours figuring out what was broken. <code>haskell-language-server</code> uses this information to set up a GHC API session. Its sufficient to understand this we need to generate some file-discovery information that <code>hls</code> can use while interacting with <code>GHC</code> API. This is required, since <code>hls</code> uses the <code>GHC API</code> for all its parsing needs. This is a way to ensure <code>hls</code> can keep up with changes to <code>GHC</code> rather than having its own implementation.</p>
<p>As of this writing, sometime the errors you get running <code>hls</code> with this step are not intuitive. You may notice the <code>IDE</code> integration works but does not work fully. If you notices any such behavior one of the potential issues, is that you have not performed this step.</p>
<p>So, here is what you need to do at the very least. You can</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>git clone https://github.com/Avi-D-coder/implicit-hie.git
cd implicit-hie

stack build
</code></pre>
<p>Identify the executable, this step creates and add it to your local path if required. Now, from the project folder you are on, run</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>    cd `to-your-project`
    gen-hie &gt; hie.yaml</code></pre>
<p>This step will create an <code>hie.yaml</code> file which automatically discovers the metadata information that is required by the <code>hls</code> to load your project successfully. The <code>hie.yaml</code> file is used by <code>hls</code> via <code>hie-bios</code> library.</p>
<p>For advanced configuration of <code>hie-bios</code> files, you can check out instructions at <a href="https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios">hie-bios</a>.</p>
<p>Once, you have a <code>hie.yaml</code> file set up in your project folder, we can move on to the next step.</p>
<p>Also, note that there are efforts to make this step automatic.</p>
<h1 id="time-to-check-if-haskell-language-server-hie.yaml-loads-the-project">Time to check if <code>haskell-language-server</code> + <code>hie.yaml</code> loads the project</h1>
<p>Before, we use our Emacs, it is helpful to run the <code>hls</code> server from the project folder and make sure the server loads without any errors. Therefore, let’s do the following</p>
<pre class="shell"><code># cd into the project folder.
# make sure you  have the generated `hie.yaml` file in that folder.

# run hls

haskell-language-server-wrapper</code></pre>
<p>If we have performed all the steps so far and if it has worked, then you will see a bunch of information rendered by this command. You will also notice, that the <code>haskell-language-server-wrapper</code> was also able to determine the versions of <code>GHC</code> and then also the corresponding <code>ghcide</code> appropriately. Here is a small section you will observe:</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>
Tool versions found on the $PATH
cabal:          2.4.1.0
stack:          2.3.1
ghc:            8.8.3


Consulting the cradle to get project GHC version...
Project GHC version: 8.8.3
haskell-language-server exe candidates: [&quot;haskell-language-server-8.8.3&quot;,&quot;haskell-language-server-8.8&quot;,&quot;haskell-language-server&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Now, say, if you or the <code>lsp-client</code> were to run a different version of <code>hls</code>, then you are likely to see this message as part of the printed output.</p>
<pre class="shell"><code>Severity: DsError
Message:
  ghcide compiled against GHC 8.10.2 but currently using 8.8.3
  This is unsupported, ghcide must be compiled with the same GHC version as the project.</code></pre>
<p>It is good to keep this in mind, if you plan on updating the <code>lsp-haskell-server-path</code> variable in the next step.</p>
<h1 id="setting-up-emacs">Setting up Emacs</h1>
<p>As of this writing, I am using <code>lsp-haskell 20200924.1508</code>. You can view this using the <code>list-packages</code> interactive command in Emacs. I think the <code>lsp-haskell</code> authors have stream-lined a lot of issues dealing with <code>haskell-language-server</code> version incompatibility issues. I really appreciate the work which has gone into this since the last release. I recommend you upgrade your <code>lsp-haskell</code> to at least this version. This version now supports <code>haskell-language-server-wrapper</code> out of the box. (The earlier versions had the default command set to <code>hie</code>, with options to switch to <code>ghcide</code> or <code>hie</code>). As, I suggested earlier, since there is a coordinated effort to bring all of this together, this switch makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Once you have this step completed, ie. lsp-haskell package installed. Start your Emacs from the project folder and you have a working version of fully integrated IDE.</p>
<p>You might want to read up some some nice <code>lsp</code> commands you might want to use from <a href="https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui"><code>lsp-ui</code></a>. You might also want to read a little about how Emacs <code>lsp-mode</code> add/organizes lsp projects.</p>
<p>Here are some demonstrations on capabilities I am currently able to use with my <code>Emacs</code> setup.</p>
