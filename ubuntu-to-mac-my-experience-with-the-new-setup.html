    <p>Recently I had an opportunity to get my hands dirty on a Mac based
development environment. I have done most of my development on Ubuntu
and getting to work on Mac was a mixed experience. As anyone would have
guessed the overall UI experience has been great.</p>
<p>Here are some of the tools I was introduced to during my first week:</p>
<p>1. SQLPro : This is a nice GUI based MySQL client. I was never impressed
with the command line MySql client. I hated it all the more once I
started using Postgress and the accompanying client. If you have used
Golden for Oracle it is on par with that tool.</p>
<p>2. iTerm2: This is the tmux equivalent and tuned towards the Mac UI
experience. The key bindings are easy to learn and worth spending time
getting used to the keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>3. Homebrew: This is the Ubuntu equivalent of apt-get. Other options
include MacPorts and Fink. I am yet to familiarize myself with the
differences between the options.</p>
<p>4. Alfred: This is a quick launch app which helps you launch
applications using Cmd-Space shortcut. This is equivalent to Alt-F2 on
Ubuntu.</p>
<p>5. PyCharm : This is not Mac specific, but this tool has been handy in
helping me step through code and understand the implementation as I
debug.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">6. Emacs on Mac : The biggest challenge I had was trying to set up</div>
</div>
<div class="system-message">
<p class="system-message-title">System Message: WARNING/2 (<tt class="docutils">/Users/gdevanla/myblog/content/ubuntu-to-mac-my-experience-with-the-new-setup.rst</tt>, line 38)</p>
Line block ends without a blank line.</div>
<p>Emacs to reflect my set up on Ubuntu. 'Monaco' is the usual font used in
most of Mac applications. But, the GUI version of Emacs just does not
render Monaco-11 or Monaco-12 in anti-aliased mode.Turning on/off
anti-aliasing did not help either. Doing anything in a font bigger than
that was very painful. Finally, I settled into to using the non
gui-version of Emacs-24. I just had to create an alias called emacs24
and make it point to the Emacs app with the non-Gui option. Here is the
instruction you will need to follow, if you had the same experience.
|  a. Install the Emacs-24.x version.
|  b. Add this line to your bash_profile.</p>
<p>alias emacs=&quot;/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs -nw&quot;</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple" start="3">
<li>And, happily run Emacs with the beautiful fonts rendered by iTerm2.</li>
</ol>
<p>This option also helps you open Emacs within one of the sessions in
iTerm2. That way you can remain working on the terminals without the
need to switch windows.</p>
<p>There are some new Python tools I have started working in lately, and
that will be the topic of my next post.</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>
